## 1. Airbnb 2016 Listings
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard built using the *Airbnb Listings 2016* dataset from Kaggle.  
The goal was to explore key factors influencing listing prices—such as the number of bedrooms, location, and time trends—while practicing fundamental Tableau skills.  
The dashboard provides a clear overview of average prices, geographic distribution, and revenue patterns across the year.
