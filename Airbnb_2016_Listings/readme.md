# Airbnb Listings Dashboard (Tableau)

## 1. Summary
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard built using the *Airbnb Listings 2016* dataset from Kaggle.  
The goal was to explore key factors influencing listing prices—such as the number of bedrooms, location, and time trends—while practicing fundamental Tableau skills.  
The dashboard provides a clear overview of average prices, geographic distribution, and revenue patterns across the year.

## 2. Data
The project uses the **Airbnb Listings 2016 dataset**, available on Kaggle:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset

The dataset includes:
- Listing characteristics (bedrooms, bathrooms, type, etc.)
- Location data (zip codes, coordinates)
- Pricing information
- Calendar data with daily availability and prices

Basic cleaning was performed before visualization, including removing missing values and filtering out invalid records.

## 3. Visualization
The Tableau dashboard contains several views:

### **Average Price by Number of Bedrooms**
Bar chart showing how median listing price increases with the number of bedrooms.

### **Count of Listings by Bedrooms**
Table summarizing the number of available listings for each bedroom category.

### **Price by Zipcode**
A map and bar chart showing geographic pricing differences across Seattle ZIP codes.

### **Revenue per Year**
A line chart visualizing weekly revenue trends throughout 2016.

These visualizations allow users to explore pricing patterns and identify how location and property features affect the cost of Airbnb listings.

## 4. Inspiration
This project was created as part of my learning journey with **Tableau**, focusing on:
- Basic data preparation  
- Dashboard creation  
- Working with maps and time-series data  
- Understanding real-world pricing trends  

The Airbnb dataset is rich, realistic, and ideal for building foundational Tableau skills.
